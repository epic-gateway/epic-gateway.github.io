### Acnodal - Realizing Kubernetes Application value   

---

Kubernetes is important and will continue evolve and grow in popularity.  It offers two critical benefits.

* Service abstraction removes the need for developers to understand infrastructure and enjoys a network effect as more abstracted infrastructure is deployment
* Highly dynamic workloads enable the rapid scaling, simplified maintenance and more importantly new types of applications platforms, the Metaverse demands containerization.

Unfortunately, just as Virtualization helped infrastructure teams but did little for developers, Kubernetes has benefited developers but the complexity of creating the infrastructure has created a significant challenge for infrastructure engineering teams.  There is a lot of activity to address the complexity of k8s infrastructure, some companies genuinely addressing complexity, some simply covering it up in UIs or packaging.

Acnodal is focused on solving a key component of the networking problem, Production Application Access.  To date are retooled web2.0 and virtualization solutions have been used in an attempt to provide application access offering limited functionality, causing developer friction, and often violating security and isolation best practices.  It is common for legacy technologies to be retooled for new environments and for them to get initial traction, until a purpose build solution becomes available.

The Acnodal Platform is the first Application Access platform built for Kubernetes using Kubernetes. Natively integrated into the k8s cluster API's using standard mechanisms, it addresses developer complexity, and follows the operational and deployment pattern of separating access from customer applications and data.  Further it provides North-South Multi-cloud compatible with Public Clouds, Vendor packaged and upstream Kubernetes.

The Application Access platform is a comprehensive turn key solution to HTTP or API applications.  Developing a platform that spans Developer Service abstraction and low level networking including routing and packet forwarding requires a unique skill.  We have employed new and leading edge technologies to implement the Acnodal platforms such as eBPF and the new Kubernetes Gateway API.

Our products include the Open Source LoadBalancer Controller PureLB, contributed to the community in 2020 and is the only Controller that support integrated CNI routing and Dual Stack IPv6.  The Application Access Platform consists of EPIC, the Application Gateway System and PureGW, the Gateway controller deployed in each Kubernetes Cluster.  The platform can be deployed on premise or in a datacenter controlled by our customers.  Acnodal also offers a Gateway-as-a-Service, where Gateways can be consumed individually, with Gateway Platforms deployed in a number of datacenters worldwide. 

Application Gateways are a fundamental infrastructure component in our interconnected world, Acnodal is committed to modernizing this key infrastructure so our customers can continue to grow and build exciting application experiences for their customers
