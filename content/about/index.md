### Acnodal leveraged Cloud re-platforming into Hyperscale applications 

---
 

Cloud re-platforming should enable every organization to scale their Cloud applications to Hyperscale.  Unfortantely todays service edge platforms, either tradition enterprise or those offered by Cloud Providers lack capability and platform integration to make scaling to hyperscale possible.

Organizations without development skills struggle with outdated technology and those with developers spend significant time and resources creating and maintaining custom solutions.  

Acnodals Solution consists of two components:

* EPIC, is the first full stack, microservice platform combining network connectivity and application request logic used to construct hyperscale applications. It is deployed at the application edge where requests diverge to different systems, on-premise, in the cloud or in datacenter or CSP network edges.

* PureLB, our Kubernetes Load Balancer controller, simplifies application access, leverages existing DevOps, integrating EPIC with multi-cloud Kubernetes.

Using the Acnodal platform, complex applications can be scaled among Cloud Providers, Private datacenters, geographically dispersed with application deployment and management using the Devops tools that manage Kubernetes
