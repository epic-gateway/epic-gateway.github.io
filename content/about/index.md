### Acnodal - Enabling Cloud & Service Heterogeneity  

---

Kubernetes is important, its Service abstraction removes the need for developers to understand infrastructure.  The Service abstraction enjoys a network effect, the more services abstracted the more powerful it becomes.  

There are numerous solutions and vendors pursuing network or application Service abstraction.  Some view the network service mesh as the foundation on which infrastructure clusters are built and others apply an application view operating at Layer 7 with Application Service Meshes.  Cloud Providers offer vertically integrated solutions each unique to their platform. They are all valid solutions, each with their strengths and weaknesses, however their primary problem is that they are all homogeneous, winner takes all implementations.

At Acnodal, we look at this problem differently. With an understanding  application developer needs and network infrastructure, we look at the problem from a customer application access perspective.  Applications are developed to serve customers, the Edge is the first place where a customer touches the application.  

Our platforms focus on the Access Edge, providing the maximum amount of functionality, visibility and control enabling those applications to be distributed among multiple service infrastructures, within one cloud, multiple clouds or emerging hybrid clouds irrespective of the Service abstraction solution used, we just require basic, standard Kubernetes. 

Our heterogeneous platform provides edge access functionality that is not offered by Cloud Providers or on-premise vendors.  Instead of sharing your edge platform with thousands of other unknown Cloud provider customers, being part of the biggest hacker honeypots in the internet, Acnodal provides an alternative that allows you to manage your customers experience, at one Cloud Provider, Multiple Cloud Providers or in a Hybrid Cloud.
