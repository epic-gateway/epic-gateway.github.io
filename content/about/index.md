### About Acnodal

---

##### _Acnodal is a cloud native network infrastructure company._ 

Containers and kubernetes are at the center of cloud native computing and Devops is the methodology used to operate these systems.  Prior to founding Acnodal we spent years working to understand the network infrastructure needs of devops teams and realized that traditional network companies viewed devops as "just another protocol problem".  They added a protocol, created their own special protocol or co-opted something from devops, then claimed "cloud native" and went back to convincing customers to buy into their technology walled garden.  

We are a new type of network infrastructure company, we focus on the deep integration necessary to successfully implement Cloud Native Infrastructure.

Acnodal, Inc. is a private company founded in 2020 by experts in large scale infrastructure development and deployment.  Contact us to learn more.
