### PureLB is Multi-arch, now supporting ARM

##### _With help from contributors PureLB now supports multi-architecture_

---

PureLB, the open-source Service Load Balancer for Kubernetes now supports both Intel and ARM
host architectures.  Working our contributors PureLB is now cross compiled and packaged so that 
it can be loaded in environments where ARM processors are used.

Support for ARM processors was the first request we received after releasing PureLB.  In addition to ARM availability in Servers and the cloud and there use in IOT, many engineers use Raspberry PI clusters for experimentation and development.

The development for ARM support was undertaken by a community developer, the PureLB community is grateful for this important contribution.
