## _EPIC_ ## 
Unlock the full functionality of Hyperscaler Ingress technology for everyone.  EPIC, the Intelligent External Ingresses operate outside the k8s cluster at the system, network and edge-compute edge implementing the logic that constructs web and mobile applications using containers, CDN and legacy systems. Ingresses replace legacy application load balancers and proxies.  The platform provides Intelligent Ingresses with devops simplicity applying native Kubernetes APIs used in public clouds avoiding specialized tooling or workflow.

EPIC, our Intelligent External Ingress resides outside of the k8s clusters enabling applications and workload components to be distributed among multiple public and private clouds.  EPIC retains and expands on the functionality of an in-cluster ingress using our unique “true-ingress” direct to POD transport.

<div class="col-md-6">
As the edge becomes more distant and distributed, it demands increased intelligence to direct customer traffic to more diverse resource endpoints including CDNs and other non-k8s endpoints.  EPIC unlocks unparalleled programmability with an individual Ingress per application enabling complex location, content and user based distribution.

Acnodal’s platform consists of the Intelligent External Ingress, EPIC and the open-source k8s Service Loadbalancer controller, PureLB.  Used alone, PureLB enables the same workflow implemented in public clouds to expose applications using local or routed networks, and can also create External Ingress Services provided by EPIC.  EPIC launches and provisions highly functional envoy proxies for every application and is multi-tenant supporting the diverse needs of development and infrastructure teams.  EPIC provides address, configuration and certificate management required to effectively control fleet’s of envoy’s running in the EPIC cluster.

EPIC, an external Ingress routes traffic directly to POD’s and is dynamically updated as workloads change, just like an in-cluster ingress.  Unlike in-cluster ingresses EPIC retains complete access to envoys configuration model and features.  Our unique “true ingress” transport, developed using eBPF connects envoy endpoints to POD transiting NAT’s to avoid increasing routing complexity where necessary.

Legacy ALB’s lack functionality and are difficult to integrate with a modern devops workflow, cloud ALB’s are tightly integrated with specific cloud providers, neither providing the level of functionality and programmability provided by the Acnodal platform
